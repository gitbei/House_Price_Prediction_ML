# House Price Prediction Model
Welcome to the House Price Prediction Model repository! This project aims to predict house prices using two popular machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree and Random Forest. The dataset used for this project includes features such as the number of rooms, bathroom count, land size, latitude, and longitude.

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning models. The goal is to provide accurate predictions by training and evaluating Decision Tree and Random Forest models. These models are chosen for their simplicity and effectiveness in handling tabular data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle includes the following features:
- Rooms: Number of rooms in the house.
- Bathroom: Number of bathrooms in the house.
- Landsize: Size of the land in square meters.
- Lattitude: Latitude of the property.
- Longtitude: Longitude of the property.
- Price: Target variable representing the price of the house.

## Model Training - Decision Tree Regressor & Random Forest Regressor. 
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the Decision Tree model on the training data.
- Predict house prices on the testing data.

## Evaluation
- The models are evaluated using the following metrics:Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- The evaluation results are used to compare the performance of the Decision Tree and Random Forest models.

## Results
- The results of the model evaluations will be displayed in the notebook. Generally, Random Forest tends to perform better than a single Decision Tree due to its ability to reduce overfitting and provide more accurate predictions.
